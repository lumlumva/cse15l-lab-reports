**Command** `cd`
1. command with no arguments

- The working directory is /home.
- Since there is no argument here, we do not have a path to switch into from the current working directory. So the system simply print out the current working directory which is /home in this example.
- This output is not an error.

2. command with a path to a directory as an argument
